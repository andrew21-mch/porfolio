    description: `
        I got into computers when I was 16, even though I didn't have much access back then. 
        I've been writing code for about four years now. I'm pretty good with PHP, and I can work with lots of other programming languages too, like Python and Java. 
        I'm a good team player and leader. I like to take charge and get things done. 
        Right now, I'm the Chief Technology Officer at a startup called Skye8. In this role, I help come up with new ideas and make sure things run smoothly.<br><br> 
        Outside of work, I teach people how to code on websites like Preply. 
        I love technology and how it can change the world. My goal is to keep learning and growing, and maybe even help others do the same along the way.<br> 
        I have worked with several companies as a software engineer, backend developer, and full-stack developer. I was also a mentor at Zuri.<br> 
        In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and spending time in nature.<br> <br>
        My journey in the world of technology has been rewarding and fulfilling. 
        I'm proud to have turned my passion into a profession. 
        As I continue to learn and grow, I recently started getting into AI, building ML models, and integrating them into projects. 
        I hope to inspire others to embrace the power of technology and never stop exploring new possibilities.
